				<h3>A Raise to the Next Dimension!!</h3>

				So far, we saw single dimension arrays. But it is possible to have 2D arrays <br><br><br><br>

				<h4>
				What do we mean when we say 2D array? <br>
				Why would we need 2D arrays? <br><br><hr><br><br>
				</h4>

				A 2D array is an array of arrays! You have a number of rows, all with the same number of columns. <br>


				Multi dimensional arrays are useful for
				<ul>
					<li>matrix calculations</li>
					<li>2D game maps</li>
				</ul>
				<br><br>

				What do you need to know when declaring 2D arrays? Why is this information important?<br><br>



				Initialization of a 2D array is similar to a 1D arrays. You can set the values when you declare it.

				<pre><code>//Type arrayName[numberOfRows][numberOfColumn];

int out_of_this_dimension[3][5];

/*
   0 1 2 3 4
   _ _ _ _ _
0 |_|_|_|_|_|
1 |_|_|_|_|_|
2 |_|_|_|_|_|

Bask in the glory of my magnificient ASCII art! 
*/

int my2d[4][3] = {{22, 23, 10},
            	  {15, 25, 13},
            	  {20, 74, 67},
            	  {11, 18, 14}};
</code></pre><br>
				
				What do you need to access an element in a 2D array? <br>

				<pre><code>cout << A[1][2];      //print an array element art row 1, column 2
A[1][2]=13;           // assign value to an array element
cin >> A[1][2];       // input element</code></pre><br>
				

				How many loops would you need to go through a 2D array?
				<pre><code>int mat[3][5], row, col ;
for (row = 0; row < 3; row++)
  for (col = 0; col < 5; col++)
    cin >> mat[row][col];
</code></pre>

				<h4>2D Arrays as Parameters</h4>

				2D arrays can be passed to functions and, like regular arrays, they are passed by references so any changes to the array made during function calls are persistent.<br>
				What is different is that you can omit the number of rows BUT you MUST specifiy the number of columns
				<h4>
				Can anyone see why that is the case?
			</h4>
				<pre><code> void print(int A[][3],int N, int M);
// ...
// Somewhere in the main

int arr[4][3];
// initialize ...

// call the print function
print(arr, 4, 3);
</code></pre>

				<pre><code>// Here is a working example
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std; 
void print(int A[][3],int N, int M)
{
  for (R = 0; R < N; R++)
    for (C = 0; C < M; C++)
       cout << A[R][C];
}

int main ()
{
  int arr[4][3] ={{12, 29, 11},
                  {25, 25, 13},
                  {24, 64, 67},
                  {11, 18, 14}};
  print(arr,4,3);
  return 0;
}
</code></pre>


				<h4>2D Array Practice</h4>
				Function to find the sum of two dimensional arrays A and B. Print the result as you go
				<pre><code>void addition(int A[][20], int B[][20],int N, int M)</code></pre><br>

				Function to find & display sum of rows & sum of cols. of a 2 dim. array A
				<pre><code>void sumRowCol(int A[][20], int N, int M)</code></pre><br>

				<hr>

				Now that we looked at arrays, we are going to talk a little bit more about strings<br>
				So far we have used C++ strings. If you noticed, you access characters in the string using the [] operator like an array.<br>
				That is because C++ strings are very similar to arrays. They are a custom class packed with rich functions<br><br>
				However, before there were C++ strings, there was C++. And before there was C++ there was C. Unfortunately C did not have C++ strings (sad face). It had C-strings. <br><br>

				<h4>
					What are strings composed of?
				</h4>

				C-Strings are arrays of characters! <br><br>

				Suppose I want to make a C-String to hold words up to 10 characters like knickknack or lumberjack<br><br>

				How long should I declare this char array variable to be? <br>

				<pre><code>
char word[10]; // allocate C-string to hold up to 10 character word
				</code></pre>

				Ok great, so we declared a variable to store all the characters of the longest word. What happens if I put the word "hello" in my variable? <br><br>


				We see that we need a way to indicate until what index is a valid word stored in our C-String variable<br><br><br>

				How do we signal the end of a C-String? <br><br>

				<pre><code>
char zero_byte = '\0';
				</code></pre>


				We can signal the end of a C-string with a special character called the zero byte '\0' <br><br>


				Going back to the example above, we see that we need one more space to hold the zero byte. So we add 1 to the array size<br><br>
				<pre><code>
char word[11]; // allocate C-string to hold up to 10 character word + ending zero byte
				</code></pre>

				<h4>
				What is the benefit of having a dedicated termination character? <br>
				What are some downsides to relying on it?<br>
				</h4>


				<br><br>

				Like arrays are several ways to initialize C-Strings. Continuing from the previous discussion about arrays can you think of proper ways to declare and initialze C-Strings? <br><br>

				Be sure to think about the zero byte! <br>

				<h4>Lets Practice what we know about C-Strings by writing our own library to make working with C-Strings easier</h4>
				Well write a few functions in this library
				<ul>
					<li>Write a function my_str_len that takes only a C-string and prints the length of the valid portion of that string
					</li>
					<li>Write a function my_str_compare that takes 2 C-strings and returns true if they are equal</li>
					<li>Write a function my_str_copy that takes 2 C-Strings, Source and Destination and copies the contents of source into Destination. (You can assume Destination will have enough space to hold all of Source)</li>
					<li>Expand on the previous function and make a new one my_str_n_copy that copies n characters from Source into Destination</li>
					<li>Write a function my_str_char_last that takes a string and a char and finds the last position of the char in the string</li>
				</ul>
				<br><br>
