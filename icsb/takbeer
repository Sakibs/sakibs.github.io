Allah is Greatest, Allah is Greatest, Allah is Greatest\n\
There is no deity but Allah\n\
Allah is Greatest, Allah is Greatest,\n\
And praise be to Allah\n\
Allah is more Greatest\n\
And praise be to Allah in abundance\n\
And glory to Allah in the early morning and the late afternoon\n\
There is no god except Allah, the One and Only\n\
He fulfilled His promise, Helped His servant, Strengthened His forces\n\
And alone routed out the clans \n\
There is no god except Allah. Him alone we worship\n\
Offering Him sincere devotion even if the disbelievers hate it\n\
O Allah, evoke Your blessings on our leader (Prophet ) Muhammad (pbuh)\n\
And the family of our leader (Prophet) Muhammad (pbuh)\n\
And the companions of our leader (Prophet) Muhammad (pbuh)\n\
And the helpers of our leader (Prophet) Muhammad (pbuh)\n\
And the wives of our leader (Prophet) Muhammad (pbuh)\n\
And the descendants of our leader (Prophet) Muhammad (pbuh)\n\
and send abundant peace upon them
